**Chapter 1: The Power of Mindset**

Your journey to wealth begins not in your bank account, but in your mind. The difference between the rich and the poor is their mindset. The wealthy believe they create their own life, while the poor believe life happens to them.

Actionable Step:
Take 15 minutes today. Write down any limiting beliefs you have about money (e.g., "money is the root of all evil," "I'm not good with money"). Acknowledge them, and then write a positive affirmation to counter each one (e.g., "Money is a tool for good," "I am a capable financial manager").

**Chapter 2: Your First Investment**

The best investment you can make is in yourself. The second best is to make your money work for you. Start small, but start now.

Actionable Step:
